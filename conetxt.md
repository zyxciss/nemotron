NVIDIA Nemotron Model Reasoning Challenge

Submit Prediction
Overview
Develop techniques that improve reasoning accuracy using NVIDIA Nemotron models.

Participants will experiment with prompting, data pipelines, and lightweight fine-tuning while evaluating their approaches on a new reasoning benchmark developed by NVIDIA Research.

Merger & Entry
Description
Reasoning benchmarks are a useful way to measure progress on structured tasks. When approaches and results are shared openly, the community can compare methods, reproduce improvements, and iterate more effectively.

Today, reasoning improvements are explored across many independent efforts - often using different datasets, prompts, and evaluation setups - making direct comparison difficult. A shared benchmark and common baseline model allow techniques to be tested and compared more consistently.

While language models perform strongly on many tasks, structured reasoning benchmarks remain an active area of research and optimization.

In this competition, participants will work from a shared Nemotron 3 Nano baseline and a novel reasoning benchmark developed by NVIDIA Research. Nemotron provides an open foundation for this challenge, including openly available models, datasets, and training recipes that participants can build on or adapt within their own workflows.

You may experiment with:

Prompting strategies
Data filtering and curation
Synthetic data generation
Reinforcement learning
Lightweight fine-tuning
Or other approaches of your choice
Participants may use any training framework, tooling, or workflow to produce their LoRA adapter. NVIDIA-provided recipes are optional starting points - competitors are free to use other ecosystems and libraries (e.g., Hugging Face, Unsloth, Axolotl, TRL, or similar tooling).

The only requirement is that the final submission produces a compatible LoRA adapter for the Nemotron-3-Nano-30B base model.

Multiple valid solution paths are expected. Clear documentation - including notebooks and write-ups - is encouraged (and required for prize eligibility) to support reproducibility and communal learning.

By bringing models, datasets, and evaluation into an open, shared environment, this challenge creates an opportunity for collaborative iteration - strengthening open reasoning workflows that others can study, reuse, and extend.

Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated based on their Accuracy in solving the provided tasks. The NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Nano-30B model is loaded with your LoRA adapter (which must include an adapter_config.json) using the vLLM inference engine. For each test case, the model is prompted to generate a response and instructed to place its final answer within a \boxed{} LaTeX command. The metric extracts the final answer from the generated text, prioritizing content within the boxed format while falling back to other heuristic patterns or the last numeric value found. A prediction is graded as correct if it matches the ground truth either exactly as a string or within a relative numerical tolerance of 
. The final score is the proportion of correctly answered questions.

You may view the implementation of the metric here: NVIDIA Nemotron Metric. It is being run with the following parameters:

Parameter	Value
max_lora_rank	32
max_tokens	7680
top_p	1.0
temperature	0.0
max_num_seqs	64
gpu_memory_utilization	0.85
max_model_len	8192
Submitting
You must submit a LoRA adapter of rank at most 32 for the NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Nano-30B model packaged into a submission.zip file. You may consider adapting the NVIDIA Nemotron Submission Demo to produce your submission.

Timeline

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.

Prizes
To be eligible for any prize, teams must publish a public Kaggle notebook and solution write-up documenting the methods, datasets, and techniques used to produce the submission. Submissions without qualifying public documentation may be deemed ineligible for prizes.

Final Leaderboard Prizes

1st Place - $25,000 + 5 DGX Sparks
2nd Place - $15,000 + 2 DGX Sparks
3rd Place - $5,000 + 1 DGX Sparks
Note: A total of eight (8) NVIDIA DGX Spark systems (Approximate Retail Value: $4,699 per system) will be awarded based on final leaderboard placement. If any team has fewer eligible members than the number of DGX Spark systems allocated for that placement, or if any team member is ineligible to receive hardware due to export, shipping, or regional restrictions, any remaining units will cascade to the next highest-ranked teams on the final leaderboard until all eight (8) DGX Spark systems have been awarded.

Each eligible participant may receive no more than one (1) DGX Spark, and only officially registered team members are eligible to receive hardware prizes. NVIDIA reserves the right to verify team membership and eligibility prior to awarding hardware prizes.

Open Progress Prize (Mid-Competition Milestone)
Open Progress Prize: $5,000 + 1 DGX Sparks

Awarded to the team with the highest leaderboard score as of the Midpoint Cut-off Date: April 9, 2026.
Methodology submissions Cut-off Date: April 16, 2026.
Winners will be announced during Cloud NEXT (April 22-24, 2026)
If the top-ranked submission at the cutoff date does not meet these requirements, the prize will be awarded to the next highest eligible submission.

In the event of a tie, the prize will be awarded to the team whose qualifying submission was submitted earliest.

Each eligible participant may receive no more than one (1) DGX Spark.

Open Contribution Awards
The Open Contribution Awards recognize techniques that meaningfully advance reasoning performance using Nemotron models.

Three awards will be granted:

Best Data/Synthetic Data Method - 1 DGX Spark
Best RL Method - 1 DGX Spark
Best Fine-tuning Method - 1 DGX Spark
Participants must submit their entry for these awards through this form linking to their notebook and clearly identifying the category being entered.

Only submissions ranking within the top 10% of the final leaderboard will be considered for Open Contribution Awards.

Compute Powered by NVIDIA Blackwell on Google Cloud
We're excited to partner with Google Cloud to offer the G4 VMs powered by NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs as the compute backbone for this challenge. G4 VMs are a strong fit for both fine‑tuning and high‑throughput inference with Nemotron models so you can iterate quickly on prompts, data pipelines, and tuning strategies while evaluating performance on real benchmarks.

NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs provide the performance and memory needed to serve open reasoning models efficiently at inference time, enabling responsive evaluation runs and rapid leaderboard iteration as you improve your Nemotron variants. Learn more about the underlying Google Cloud G4 VM and its capabilities here.
